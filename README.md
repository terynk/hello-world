Onboarding Git Assignment CodeDay Labs 2021

I am excited to be working with everyone. My name is Teryn Kum and I will be an incoming Sophomore at the University of California, Irvine this fall. Overall I'm a pretty active person and love being outdoors/exploring new places. I played a fair amount of sports growing up and also enjoy listening to music. I started getting into computer science in high school since it was offered as an elective. I enjoy problem solving and activities that involve it such as escape rooms. I can't wait to get to know everyone better throughout the program and look forward to seeing you all soon!
